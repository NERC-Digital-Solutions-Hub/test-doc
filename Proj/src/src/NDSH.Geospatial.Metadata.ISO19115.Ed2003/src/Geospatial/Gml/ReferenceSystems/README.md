`See ISO/DIS 19136 13.2.`

The reference systems schema components have two logical parts, which define elements and types for XML encoding of the definitions of:

- `Identified Object`, inherited by the ten types of GML objects used for coordinate reference systems and coordinate operations
- High-level part of the definitions of coordinate reference systems

This schema encodes the `Identified Object` and `Reference System` packages of the UML Model for `ISO 19111`.
